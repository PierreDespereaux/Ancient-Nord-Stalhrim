I have always been annoyed that high-level Draugr use Ebony weapons. The Ebony we see in-game is in the Dunmer style, so it feels really weird to see Ancient Nords wielding it alongside their tradtional Nordic weaponry. So I set out to make a mod that would fix this little niggle I had with the game. With the help of my buddy opusGlass and jboyd4 we have made a new variant of Ancient Nord weapon that is more suiting for the draugr the walk Skyrim's crypts: Ancient Stalhrim!

-   Introduces a whole new weapon type to the game: Ancient Stalhrim!
-   A brand new sword, greatsword, war axe, battleaxe, and bow and arrow.
-   The new weapons are effected by your choice of Stalhrim and Ancient Nordic retextures!
-   High-level draugr will now wield Ancient Stalhrim instead of Ebony.
-   Ancient Stalhrim weapons can be reforged into Stalhrim Hero weapons at the Skyforge after you complete both the [Companions](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Companions) questline and [A New Source of Stalhrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_New_Source_of_Stalhrim).
